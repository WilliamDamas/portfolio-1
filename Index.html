            <p>William Chalmi is my name dark smart and unconventional humor is the name of my game. Overly confident easy
                going type of guy, but being too judgmental, loud and overly perverted is preventing me from building friendships.
                Strangers say I can be a bit too obnoxious and straightforward. I don't mind to be called so because I wouldn't
                mind being treated the same way too. People say honesty is key to a good friendship and I simply think that
                people nowadays can't handle it. They just like over quote movies way too much to sound cool and wise. Which
                brings me to my other big thing about myself aside from ego that I set aside when I learn. I am a huge hater
                of the common social media culture, politically correct language, pugs and their lover's owners and breeders.
                one of my all-time dreams is to be famous for a scientific achievement of some kind. I know someday I will
                make it due to my vast imagination stubbernes and unsatisfactory views I have about the state of our current
                condition as a species. </p>
